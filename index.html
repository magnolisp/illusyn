<h1>Illusyn</h1>
<p>
The <i>Illusyn</i> (Illusionary Syntax) library is an experimental solution for the definition of abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to support program transformations. It is written in <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, and relies on Racket's macro system for both declaring AST operations and implementing them.
</p>

<p>
Illusyn is currently only available as part of the <i>Magnolisp</i> language implementation. Magnolisp makes extensive use of the Illusyn library, and can therefore be regarded as a sample application for Illusyn. With Magnolisp installed, it is possible to use the Illusyn library from other applications as well, without having to install a separate copy.
